# EndToEndLLM_VectorDBPineCone
This application is going to cover an end to end general LLM model.

## Steps
- *PDF*: We have a pdf
- *Text Chunks*: We will load the document and convert it into text chunks
- *Open AI Embeddings*: Now, we will convert the text chunks into vectors
- *Vector Search DB*: We will put all of the embeddings into a VectorSearch DB (We will use Pinecone in our case)
- *Similarity Search*: When the user queries, the search will be based on similarity search
